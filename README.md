## Assembler and Simulator for 16-Bit RISC ISA
A 16-Bit Assembler and Simulator using Python.
Program takes Assembly code as Input and gives Machine Code
as output. It also detects error present in the Assembly Code.
It also simulates the given Machine code and indicate the state
of CPU Registers.

## Steps to RunðŸ’»
